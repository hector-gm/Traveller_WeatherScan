## Usage
When page loads, users can type a city name into the search bar and submit their city name value with the search button. The website then pulls data from the OpenWeather Map API to display current weather information matching the user's input. 

Additionally, the website displays the five day forecast for the destination city below the current weather.

The user's searches are saved to local storage and city name shortcuts are displayed below the search bar on following visits to the site.
